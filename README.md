# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    To describe the time and complexity of a given algorithm under its worst case.

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    speed and spce

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   Binary Search

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    O(log n)

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    O(1) has the same time output regardless of number of inputs
    0(n) is something that runs a single operation per given element
    0(n^2) has to run a ^2 operations per given element. ex looping over each element of an array and for each element of the array looping back over the whole array

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    0(log n) would be a function that can leave large chunks of data unevaluated
    0(n log n) is usually some kind of sorting function that has to check to make sure its output is actually sorted.

  PART TWO: In a new file, write examples of algorithms/functions for each of the Big O complexities below.
    Upload your file to your repository when complete and submit in Learn --> Exercises.

    1. O(1)

    2. O(n)

    3. O(n^2)
